1) Generics allows for the use of many data types in a single class, interface or method using < >. This allows any object of that type to be used. ex ArrayList<Integer> will allow any Integer to be added.
2) You wouldn't want to use recursion in a situation in which it would cause a stack overflow
3) Throwable is less specific and can throw any errors. Throwable is can also be put on one line making the code a bit more compact
